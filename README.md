Layout and Structure: Begin by creating the basic layout structure for your dashboard page. This might include a header, sidebar/menu, and a main content area where the dashboard components will be displayed.
Header: The header section typically contains branding/logo, navigation links, user profile/avatar, and any other relevant information or controls. You might include a "Logout" button or a dropdown menu for user settings.

Main Content Area: This is where the actual dashboard components will be displayed. Depending on your application's requirements, this area might contain various widgets, charts, graphs, tables, or other components to present data and information to the user.
Dashboard Components: Develop individual components to represent different sections or widgets within your dashboard. These components might fetch data from APIs or store states and render relevant information dynamically.
